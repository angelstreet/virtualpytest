# Shared Library Environment Variables
# 
# WARNING: DO NOT COPY THIS FILE AS .env IN THE SHARED DIRECTORY!
# 
# The shared library receives environment variables from calling services.
# Add these variables to your service's .env file instead:
# - backend-server/.env
# - backend-host/.env
# - frontend/.env (if using shared utilities)
#
# Then initialize shared services in your service code:
# from shared.lib.utils.env_utils import init_backend_server_shared
# service_env = init_backend_server_shared()
