  4. Check for:
     - Missing steps
     - Unexpected failures
     - Timeout issues
     - Incomplete execution
  5. Generate validation report
  
  ## VALIDATION CHECKS
  - All steps executed?
  - Expected assertions passed?
  - Screenshots captured?
  - Execution time within bounds?
  
  ## OUTPUT
  - VALID: Results match expectations
  - INVALID: Specific issues found
  - NEEDS_REVIEW: Ambiguous results
