TASK: Perform COMPREHENSIVE STEP-BY-STEP analysis to determine if this test execution result is valid or should be discarded.

SCRIPT-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:

1. **STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION VERIFICATION**:
   - Examine each navigation step in the report
   - Verify each action (click, swipe, type, wait) executed correctly
   - Check each verification/assertion passed or failed appropriately
   - Identify any step sequence inconsistencies or unexpected jumps
   - Analyze action timing and response delays

2. **ACTION EXECUTION VALIDATION**:
   - **Navigation actions**: Did each navigation command reach the intended target?
   - **Input actions**: Were text inputs, button clicks, and gestures executed properly?
   - **Wait actions**: Did waits complete appropriately for UI loading?
   - **Timing analysis**: Are action execution times reasonable for the device/interface?

3. **VERIFICATION AND ASSERTION ANALYSIS**:
   - **UI verifications**: Do screenshots match expected interface states?
   - **Content verifications**: Is displayed content correct for the navigation path?
   - **State verifications**: Are device/app states as expected after each step?
   - **Error handling**: Are verification failures due to real issues or false positives?

4. **SCRIPT TYPE-SPECIFIC LOGIC**:
   - **goto/navigation**: Focus on successful path completion and final destination
   - **validation**: Emphasize verification accuracy and content correctness
   - **performance**: Analyze timing thresholds and response patterns
   - **regression**: Compare against expected baseline behaviors

5. **INFRASTRUCTURE VS APPLICATION ISSUES**:
   - **Infrastructure failures**: Network timeouts, device connectivity, test framework issues
   - **Application failures**: UI bugs, functional regressions, content errors
   - **Environmental factors**: Test data issues, configuration problems, timing dependencies

6. **EXECUTION CONTEXT EVALUATION**:
   - **Success with long execution**: Normal for complex navigation sequences
   - **Failure patterns**: Distinguish between systematic issues and transient problems
   - **Device-specific behaviors**: Account for device model performance characteristics

DECISION CRITERIA:
- **DISCARD (false positive)** if: Infrastructure/environment issues, test framework problems, timing-related transient failures
- **KEEP (valid result)** if: Legitimate functional issues, real application bugs, or successful test completion

CRITICAL RULES:
- SUCCESS=true should almost NEVER be discarded unless clear infrastructure evidence
- Long execution times alone (30s-120s) are NOT grounds for discard if steps completed successfully
- Only discard failures if you can clearly identify infrastructure/environment root cause from step analysis
