When this weakness is present, if these logs are accessible to an attacker, it may give them clues as to the inner workings of the app, helping them plan a focused attack. For example, clues revealing SQL database details may help plan an SQL injection attack.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Keep error messages to the barest minimum of helpful information that users absolutely need to know.\n* Use consistent error messages that do not give attackers clues that they might be on the right track to a successful attack, such as \"File not found\" or \"User name does not exist\".\n* Ensure that debugging information is removed from code prior to release.\n* Create clear policy for the types of errors that must be logged, which messages will be displayed to users, and which details will be logged for later alerting and debugging.\n* When logging error details, never include sensitive information such as passwords.\n* Implement naming conventions that will help you flag and defend sensitive information.\n* Use dynamic (white box) test techniques to identify conditions that could cause errors and failures and test thoroughly to ensure that the code performs gracefully without revealing sensitive data under these stress conditions.",

The server then accesses the URL and shares its results, which may include sensitive information such as AWS metadata, internal configuration information, or database contents with the attacker. Because the request comes from the back end, it bypasses access controls, potentially exposing information the user does not have sufficient privileges to receive. The attacker can then exploit this information to gain access, modify the web application, or demand a ransom payment.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Blacklists are problematic and attackers have numerous ways to bypass them; ideally, use a whitelist of all permitted domains and IP addresses.\n* Use authentication even within your own network to prevent exploitation of server-side requests.\n* Implement zero trust and sanitize and validate all URL and header data returning to the server from the user. Strip invalid or suspect characters, then inspect to be certain it contains a valid and expected value.\n* Ideally, avoid sending server requests based on user-provided data altogether.\n* Ensure that you are not sending raw response bodies from the server directly to the client. Only deliver expected responses.\n* Disable suspect and exploitable URL schemas. Common culprits include obscure and little-used schemas such as `file://`, `dict://`, `ftp://`, and `gopher://`.",

This means that browsers can only retrieve data from another site if the two sites share the same domain. In today's complex online environment, however, sites and applications often need to retrieve data from other domains. This is done under fairly limited conditions through an exception to the same origin policy known as \"cross-origin resource sharing\".\n\nDevelopers may create definitions of trusted domains that are broader than absolutely necessary, inadvertently opening up wider access than intended. This weakness could result in data exposure or loss, or even allow an attacker to take over the site or application.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Avoid using wildcards for cross-origin resource sharing. Instead, define intended domains explicitly.\n* Ensure that your site or app is well defended against cross-site scripting attacks (XSS), which could lead to takeover via an overly permissive cross-domain policy.\n* Do not mix secure and insecure protocols when defining cross-domain policies.\n* Consider defining a clear approved list to specify which domains will be given resource-level access; use this approved list to validate all domain access requests.\n* Clearly define which methods (view, read, and update) are permitted for each resource and domain to avoid abuse.",

                "markdown": "## Details\n\nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\n\nThis is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser's Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they've been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n\nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.\n\n### Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user's browser.|\n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user's browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n### Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n## Best practices for prevention\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code:\n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches.\n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.\n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.",

                "markdown": "## Details\n\nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\n\nThis is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser's Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they've been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n\nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.\n\n### Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user's browser.|\n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user's browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n### Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n## Best practices for prevention\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code:\n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches.\n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.\n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.",
