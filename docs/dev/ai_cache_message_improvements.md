# AI Plan Cache - Message Improvements Summary

## What Changed

Updated all cache-related logging to make it **crystal clear** that cache misses are **normal, expected behavior** and not errors.

---

## Before (Confusing)

```
[@ai_plan_generation_db] Error getting plan by fingerprint: {'message': 'JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned', 'code': 'PGRST116', 'details': 'The result contains 0 rows'}
[@ai_plan_cache] No cached plan found for prompt: 'go to live TV'
[@ai_executor] Cache miss for prompt: 'go to live TV' - generating new plan
[@ai_executor] Generating new plan (cache miss - will be cached after successful execution)
```

**Problems:**
- ‚ùå Starts with "Error" - looks like something went wrong
- ‚ùå Shows raw Supabase error message (confusing technical details)
- ‚ùå Doesn't explain if this is normal or a problem
- ‚ùå No clear indication of what happens next

---

## After (Clear & Explicit)

```
[@ai_plan_cache] Checking cache for fingerprint: c5f7b9d3... (prompt: 'go to live TV...')
[@ai_plan_generation_db] ‚úì Cache MISS for fingerprint c5f7b9d3... (normal - no cached plan exists yet)
[@ai_plan_cache] No exact match found. Trying compatible plans...
[@ai_plan_cache] ‚úì Cache MISS (normal) - No cached plan exists for this prompt+context combination.
[@ai_plan_cache]   ‚Üí Will generate NEW plan with AI and cache it after successful execution
[@ai_executor] ‚úì Cache miss (normal) - Will generate new plan with AI
[@ai_executor] ü§ñ Generating new plan with AI (will be cached after successful execution for future reuse)
```

**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Clearly states "(normal)" - not an error
- ‚úÖ Uses ‚úì symbol for normal operations, ‚ùå for actual errors
- ‚úÖ Explains what happens next ("will generate NEW plan")
- ‚úÖ Shows the caching strategy ("cached after successful execution")
- ‚úÖ Hides confusing Supabase error codes (PGRST116) behind user-friendly message

---

## Message Types

### ‚úì Normal Operations (Green/Success)

```
‚úì Cache HIT (exact match)! Using cached plan: a3f5c9d2...
‚úì Cache HIT (compatible plan)! Fingerprint: a3f5c9d2... (success rate: 0.95)
‚úì Cache MISS (normal) - No cached plan exists for this prompt+context combination.
‚úì Cache MISS for fingerprint c5f7b9d3... (normal - no cached plan exists yet)
‚úì Stored successful plan in cache: c5f7b9d3... (will be reused for future identical requests)
```

### ‚ùå Actual Errors (Red/Failure)

```
‚ùå Database error getting plan: Connection timeout after 30s
‚ùå Failed to store plan in cache: c5f7b9d3...
‚ö†Ô∏è Exact match has INVALID format - auto-deleting: a3f5c9d2
```

### ü§ñ AI Activity

```
ü§ñ Generating new plan with AI (will be cached after successful execution for future reuse)
ü§ñ Generating new plan with AI (caching disabled - plan will NOT be saved)
```

---

## Code Changes

### 1. Database Layer (`ai_plan_generation_db.py`)

**Before:**
```python
except Exception as e:
    print(f"[@ai_plan_generation_db] Error getting plan by fingerprint: {e}")
    return None
```

**After:**
```python
except Exception as e:
    error_str = str(e)
    # Check if it's a normal "no rows" response (cache miss - not an error)
    if 'PGRST116' in error_str or '0 rows' in error_str or 'no rows' in error_str.lower():
        print(f"[@ai_plan_generation_db] ‚úì Cache MISS for fingerprint {fingerprint[:8]}... (normal - no cached plan exists yet)")
    else:
        # Actual error (connection, permission, etc.)
        print(f"[@ai_plan_generation_db] ‚ùå Database error getting plan: {e}")
    return None
```

**Key Improvement:** Detects Supabase "0 rows" response and explains it's normal.

---

### 2. Cache Layer (`ai_plan_cache.py`)

**Before:**
```python
print(f"[@ai_plan_cache] No cached plan found for prompt: '{prompt}'")
```

**After:**
```python
print(f"[@ai_plan_cache] ‚úì Cache MISS (normal) - No cached plan exists for this prompt+context combination.")
print(f"[@ai_plan_cache]   ‚Üí Will generate NEW plan with AI and cache it after successful execution")
```

**Key Improvement:** Multi-line explanation with next steps.

---

### 3. Executor Layer (`ai_executor.py`)

**Before:**
```python
print(f"[@ai_executor] Using cached plan: {cached_plan['fingerprint']}")
```

**After:**
```python
print(f"[@ai_executor] ‚úì Using cached plan (no AI call needed): {cached_plan['fingerprint'][:8]}...")
```

**Key Improvement:** Explains benefit (no AI call = faster + cheaper).

---

## User Experience Impact

### For Developers Monitoring Logs

**Before:** üò∞ "Why do I keep seeing 'Error getting plan'? Is something broken?"  
**After:** üòä "Ah, cache miss is normal for first runs. Got it!"

### For System Administrators

**Before:** üò∞ "Should I investigate this PGRST116 error?"  
**After:** üòä "‚úì Cache MISS (normal) - no action needed"

### For Performance Monitoring

**Before:** Hard to distinguish real errors from cache misses  
**After:** Clear symbols make it easy to filter:
- `grep "‚ùå"` - Show only real errors
- `grep "‚úì Cache HIT"` - Show cache efficiency
- `grep "ü§ñ"` - Track AI generation frequency

---

## Validation

### Real Error Example (Connection Issue)

```bash
# Old logs would show:
[@ai_plan_generation_db] Error getting plan by fingerprint: Connection timeout

# New logs show:
[@ai_plan_generation_db] ‚ùå Database error getting plan: Connection timeout
```

**Clear distinction:** ‚ùå indicates action needed (fix connection).

---

### Normal Cache Miss Example

```bash
# Old logs would show:
[@ai_plan_generation_db] Error getting plan by fingerprint: {...'code': 'PGRST116'...}

# New logs show:
[@ai_plan_generation_db] ‚úì Cache MISS for fingerprint c5f7b9d3... (normal - no cached plan exists yet)
```

**Clear distinction:** ‚úì indicates everything working as designed.

---

## Documentation

Updated documentation files:
- ‚úÖ `docs/dev/ai_cache_logging.md` - Comprehensive guide with examples
- ‚úÖ `docs/testcase_builder.md` - Cache behavior section updated

---

## Testing the Changes

To see the new messages in action:

1. **First execution (Cache MISS):**
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u host.service -f | grep "@ai_plan"
   ```

2. **Look for:**
   - `‚úì Cache MISS (normal)` - First execution
   - `ü§ñ Generating new plan` - AI being called
   - `‚úì Stored successful plan` - Plan cached

3. **Second execution (Cache HIT):**
   - `‚úì Cache HIT (exact match)!` - Using cached plan
   - `‚úì Using cached plan (no AI call needed)` - Fast execution

---

## Rollback Plan

If messages cause issues, revert with:
```bash
git checkout HEAD -- shared/src/lib/database/ai_plan_generation_db.py
git checkout HEAD -- shared/src/lib/executors/ai_plan_cache.py
git checkout HEAD -- shared/src/lib/executors/ai_executor.py
```

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Monitor logs on next AI execution
2. ‚úÖ Verify "0 rows" no longer confusing
3. ‚úÖ Update monitoring dashboards to use new symbols
4. ‚úÖ Train team on new log format

---

## Related Issues

This fixes the confusion reported in:
- User complaint: "there is an issue to find plan in db"
- Root cause: "0 rows" message looked like an error
- Solution: Explicit "(normal)" qualifier + clear next steps
