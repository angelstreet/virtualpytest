# Freeze Detection Feature for Zapping Analysis

## Overview
Add freeze detection capability to the existing zapping detection system with minimal code changes. The system learns on first successful detection and uses that method consistently for all subsequent zaps.

## Problem Statement
Current zapping detection only handles blackscreen transitions. Some devices use freeze-frame zapping where the image freezes instead of going black during channel changes. This causes zapping detection to fail on freeze-only devices.

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTED SOLUTION**
- **Simple Learning**: Learn on first successful detection, then stick with that method
- **Freeze Sequence Detection**: Detects consecutive frozen frames (diff=0.00) as zapping indicators
- **Single Frame Sensitivity**: Even 1 frozen comparison (2 identical images) triggers freeze detection
- **Reuse Existing**: Enhanced existing `detect_freeze()` method for zapping detection
- **Backward Compatible**: No API changes, same result format, no UI modifications

## ✅ **ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### Simple Learning Logic in ZapController
```python
# In ZapController.__init__()
self.learned_detection_method = None  # Learn on first success

def _analyze_zapping(self, context, iteration: int, action_command: str, action_end_time: float = None):
    """Smart zapping analysis - learn on first success, then stick with that method."""
    
    # If we already learned the method, use it directly
    if self.learned_detection_method:
        print(f"🧠 [ZapController] Using learned method: {self.learned_detection_method}")
        if self.learned_detection_method == 'freeze':
            return self._try_freeze_detection(context, iteration, action_command, action_end_time)
        else:
            return self._try_blackscreen_detection(context, iteration, action_command, action_end_time)
    
    # Learning phase - try blackscreen first
    zapping_result = self._try_blackscreen_detection(context, iteration, action_command, action_end_time)
    
    # If blackscreen succeeds, learn it
    if zapping_result.get('zapping_detected', False):
        self.learned_detection_method = 'blackscreen'
        print(f"✅ [ZapController] Learned method: blackscreen (will use for all future zaps)")
        return zapping_result
    
    # If blackscreen fails, try freeze as fallback
    zapping_result = self._try_freeze_detection(context, iteration, action_command, action_end_time)
    
    # If freeze succeeds, learn it
    if zapping_result.get('zapping_detected', False):
        self.learned_detection_method = 'freeze'
        print(f"✅ [ZapController] Learned method: freeze (will use for all future zaps)")
    
    return zapping_result
```

### Enhanced Freeze Detection Method
```python
def detect_freeze_in_images(self, image_paths: List[str], freeze_threshold: float = 1.0) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Enhanced freeze detection for zapping - detects freeze SEQUENCES, not just all-frozen frames."""
    
    # Compare consecutive frames for freeze detection
    comparisons = []
    for i in range(len(images) - 1):
        img1, img2 = images[i], images[i + 1]
        
        # Optimized sampling for pixel difference (every 10th pixel for performance)
        sample_rate = 10
        img1_sampled = img1['image'][::sample_rate, ::sample_rate]
        img2_sampled = img2['image'][::sample_rate, ::sample_rate]
        
        # Calculate difference
        diff = cv2.absdiff(img1_sampled, img2_sampled)
        mean_diff = np.mean(diff)
        
        comparison = {
            'frame1': img1['filename'],
            'frame2': img2['filename'],
            'mean_difference': round(float(mean_diff), 2),
            'is_frozen': bool(mean_diff < freeze_threshold),  # diff=0.00 < 1.0 = frozen
            'threshold': freeze_threshold
        }
        comparisons.append(comparison)
    
    # Find freeze sequences - look for consecutive frozen frames
    max_consecutive_frozen = 0
    current_consecutive = 0
    
    for comp in comparisons:
        if comp['is_frozen']:
            current_consecutive += 1
            max_consecutive_frozen = max(max_consecutive_frozen, current_consecutive)
        else:
            current_consecutive = 0
    
    # Detect freeze if we have at least 1 frozen frame comparison (2 identical images = freeze)
    freeze_sequence_detected = max_consecutive_frozen >= 1
    freeze_detected = freeze_sequence_detected
    
    return {
        'success': True,
        'freeze_detected': freeze_detected,
        'freeze_sequence_detected': freeze_sequence_detected,
        'max_consecutive_frozen': max_consecutive_frozen,
        'frozen_comparisons': sum(1 for comp in comparisons if comp['is_frozen']),
        'frame_comparisons': len(comparisons),
        'comparisons': comparisons,
        'confidence': 0.9 if freeze_detected else 0.1
    }
```

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

### What Was Actually Implemented:

#### **1. Enhanced Freeze Detection Logic**
- **Freeze Sequence Detection**: Look for consecutive frozen frames (diff < 1.0), not all frames frozen
- **Single Frame Sensitivity**: Even 1 frozen comparison (2 identical images) triggers detection
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses every 10th pixel sampling for fast comparison
- **Detailed Analysis**: Tracks max consecutive frozen frames and freeze sequences

#### **2. Simple Learning Logic**
- Learn on **first successful detection** (blackscreen or freeze)
- Use **learned method** for all subsequent zaps
- **No complex device patterns** - just simple session learning
- **Automatic Fallback**: Try blackscreen first, then freeze if blackscreen fails

#### **3. Key Detection Improvements**
- **Before**: Required ALL frames to be frozen → Often failed
- **After**: Requires ≥1 consecutive frozen frames → Detects any freeze sequence
- **Threshold**: diff=0.00 < freeze_threshold=1.0 → Frozen frame detected
- **Duration**: Each frozen comparison = ~0.2s freeze duration

#### **4. Smart Statistics Display**
```python
# Shows consistent method after learning
if blackscreen_count > 0 and freeze_count > 0:
    # Learning phase - show both
    print(f"   🔍 Learning: ⬛ Blackscreen: {blackscreen_count}, 🧊 Freeze: {freeze_count}")
elif blackscreen_count > 0:
    print(f"   ⬛ Detection method: Blackscreen ({blackscreen_count}/{self.total_iterations})")
elif freeze_count > 0:
    print(f"   🧊 Detection method: Freeze ({freeze_count}/{self.total_iterations})")

# Show learned method at end
print(f"🧠 [ZapController] Learned detection method: {method_emoji} {self.learned_detection_method}")
```
