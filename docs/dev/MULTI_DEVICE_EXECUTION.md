# Multi-Device Script Execution Implementation

## 🎯 Overview
Implementation of multi-device script execution capability in the RunTests frontend, allowing users to execute scripts on multiple host/device combinations simultaneously with real-time progress updates.

## 📋 Requirements
- **Primary Device**: First selected host/device is automatic (no Add button needed)
- **Additional Devices**: Optional "Add Device" button to add more host/device combinations
- **Stream Switching**: Dropdown to switch stream view between devices when multiple selected
- **Real-Time Updates**: Show individual completion status as each script finishes
- **Execution Lock**: Prevent new executions until all current ones complete
- **Minimal Changes**: Reuse existing interfaces and logic where possible

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Data Structures
```typescript
// Additional devices (beyond primary selection)
additionalDevices: {hostName: string, deviceId: string}[]

// Stream view control
streamViewIndex: number  // 0 = primary, 1+ = additional devices

// Real-time progress tracking
completionStats: {
  total: number;
  completed: number; 
  successful: number;
}
```

### Hook Extensions
```typescript
// Extended useScript interface
interface UseScriptReturn {
  executeScript: (existing method)
  executeMultipleScripts: (executions, onComplete) => Promise<results>
  isExecuting: boolean
  executingIds: string[]  // Track individual executions
  lastResult: ScriptExecutionResult | null
  error: string | null
}
```

### User Flow
1. **Select Primary Device**: Use existing host/device dropdowns
2. **Add More Devices**: Click "Add Device" button to add host/device pairs
3. **View Devices**: See selected devices as removable chips
4. **Switch Stream**: Use dropdown to view different device streams
5. **Execute Script**: Click execute to run on all devices in parallel
6. **Monitor Progress**: See real-time completion status and running count
7. **View Results**: Individual execution records in history table

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ **Primary Device Auto-Selection**: First device selected automatically
- ✅ **Optional Multi-Device**: Add button for additional devices
- ✅ **Stream Switching**: Dropdown to switch between device streams
- ✅ **Parallel Execution**: All devices execute simultaneously
- ✅ **Real-Time Updates**: Individual completion notifications
- ✅ **Execution Lock**: Prevent new runs until all complete

### Technical Requirements
- ✅ **Minimal Code Changes**: Reuse existing interfaces and logic
- ✅ **Concurrent Polling**: Independent polling for each device
- ✅ **Error Isolation**: Device failures don't affect others
- ✅ **State Management**: Clean state updates and cleanup

### User Experience
- ✅ **Intuitive UI**: Clear device selection and management
- ✅ **Visual Feedback**: Progress indicators and status updates
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and recovery

## 📊 Current Status: **100% Complete** 🎉

### Completed ✅
- Architecture design and planning
- Technical requirements analysis
- Implementation strategy
- useScript.ts hook enhancements with concurrent polling
- Frontend state management for multi-device support
- Add Device UI components with chips management
- Stream viewer device switching functionality
- Multi-device execution logic with real-time updates

### Implementation Summary ✅
1. ✅ Extended useScript.ts with executeMultipleScripts method
2. ✅ Added state management to RunTests.tsx for additional devices
3. ✅ Implemented Add Device UI components with chips
4. ✅ Added stream viewer device switching dropdown
5. ✅ Created execution logic with real-time live updates
6. ✅ Added progress indicators and execution lock mechanism

## 🔧 Implementation Notes

### Key Design Decisions
- **Backward Compatibility**: Keep existing single-device flow unchanged
- **State Separation**: Additional devices separate from primary selection
- **Real-Time Updates**: Use callbacks for immediate UI updates
- **Execution Lock**: Prevent concurrent multi-device runs

### Challenges Addressed
- **Multiple Polling**: Each device gets independent polling loop
- **State Synchronization**: Real-time updates without race conditions
- **Error Handling**: Isolated failures with graceful degradation
- **UI Responsiveness**: Live progress without blocking interface

## 🎉 Implementation Complete!

### **Key Features Delivered**
- ✅ **Multi-Device Selection**: Add button to select multiple host/device combinations
- ✅ **Real-Time Updates**: Live progress updates as each script completes
- ✅ **Stream Switching**: Dropdown to switch between device streams
- ✅ **Parallel Execution**: All devices execute simultaneously with independent polling
- ✅ **Execution Lock**: Prevents new executions until all current ones complete
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators showing completion stats and running devices
- ✅ **Minimal Changes**: Reused existing interfaces and logic (ExecutionRecord, useScript patterns)

### **User Experience Flow**
```
1. Select primary host/device (automatic)
2. Optional: Click "Add Device" for more combinations
3. See selected devices as removable chips
4. Optional: Switch stream view between devices
5. Click "Execute Script on X devices"
6. Watch real-time progress with individual completion toasts
7. View individual execution records in history
```

### **Technical Highlights**
- **Concurrent Polling**: Each device has independent polling loop
- **Live Callbacks**: Real-time UI updates without waiting for all to complete
- **Error Isolation**: One device failure doesn't affect others
- **State Management**: Clean separation of primary vs additional devices
- **Backward Compatibility**: Single device flow works exactly as before
