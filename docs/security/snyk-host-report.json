                "markdown": "## Details\n\nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\n\nBeing able to access and manipulate an arbitrary path leads to vulnerabilities when a program is being run with privileges that the user providing the path should not have. A website with a path traversal vulnerability would allow users access to sensitive files on the server hosting it. CLI programs may also be vulnerable to path traversal if they are being ran with elevated privileges (such as with the setuid or setgid flags in Unix systems).\n\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\n\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```",

When this weakness is present, if these logs are accessible to an attacker, it may give them clues as to the inner workings of the app, helping them plan a focused attack. For example, clues revealing SQL database details may help plan an SQL injection attack.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Keep error messages to the barest minimum of helpful information that users absolutely need to know.\n* Use consistent error messages that do not give attackers clues that they might be on the right track to a successful attack, such as \"File not found\" or \"User name does not exist\".\n* Ensure that debugging information is removed from code prior to release.\n* Create clear policy for the types of errors that must be logged, which messages will be displayed to users, and which details will be logged for later alerting and debugging.\n* When logging error details, never include sensitive information such as passwords.\n* Implement naming conventions that will help you flag and defend sensitive information.\n* Use dynamic (white box) test techniques to identify conditions that could cause errors and failures and test thoroughly to ensure that the code performs gracefully without revealing sensitive data under these stress conditions.",

This means that browsers can only retrieve data from another site if the two sites share the same domain. In today's complex online environment, however, sites and applications often need to retrieve data from other domains. This is done under fairly limited conditions through an exception to the same origin policy known as \"cross-origin resource sharing\".\n\nDevelopers may create definitions of trusted domains that are broader than absolutely necessary, inadvertently opening up wider access than intended. This weakness could result in data exposure or loss, or even allow an attacker to take over the site or application.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Avoid using wildcards for cross-origin resource sharing. Instead, define intended domains explicitly.\n* Ensure that your site or app is well defended against cross-site scripting attacks (XSS), which could lead to takeover via an overly permissive cross-domain policy.\n* Do not mix secure and insecure protocols when defining cross-domain policies.\n* Consider defining a clear approved list to specify which domains will be given resource-level access; use this approved list to validate all domain access requests.\n* Clearly define which methods (view, read, and update) are permitted for each resource and domain to avoid abuse.",
