# NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY OR FALLBACK CODE
**NEVER implement backward compatibility, legacy support, or fallback mechanisms.**

## Rules:
1. **Clean Implementation Only**: Always implement the new architecture without maintaining old code paths
2. **No Legacy Fallbacks**: Do not create "fallback to legacy" or "backward compatibility" code
3. **Fail Fast**: If the new implementation doesn't work, fix the root cause - don't add fallbacks
4. **Delete Legacy**: When refactoring, delete old code completely rather than keeping it as backup
5. **Single Source of Truth**: Use only one implementation approach, not multiple for "compatibility"
6. **No documentation**: Never write documentation .md except if asked

## Examples of FORBIDDEN patterns:
```python
# ❌ FORBIDDEN - Legacy fallback
try:
    new_implementation()
except:
    legacy_implementation()  # NO!

# ❌ FORBIDDEN - Backward compatibility
if use_new_system:
    new_approach()
else:
    old_approach()  # NO!

# ❌ FORBIDDEN - Dual implementation
def process_data(use_legacy=False):
    if use_legacy:
        return legacy_process()  # NO!
    return new_process()
```

## Correct approach:
```python
# ✅ CORRECT - Clean implementation only
def process_data():
    return new_implementation()  # Fix this if it doesn't work
```

## When encountering issues:
- **Fix the root cause** in the new implementation
- **Don't add fallbacks** to make it "work temporarily"
- **Delete old code** completely during migration
- **Ensure proper architecture** rather than patching with legacy code

**Remember: Clean code means one way to do things, not multiple ways for "compatibility"**
